# Design Decisions and Rationale

## Goals

- **Scalability:** Ensure the pipeline can handle large volumes of simulation data.
- **Maintainability:** Keep the code modular and well-documented for easy updates.
- **Data Integrity:** Implement thorough logging and error handling for reliable data processing.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with AWS services for storage and compute, and optionally with SQL data warehousing for querying.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Bash Scripting:**  
   - Chosen for its simplicity and ubiquity on Unix-like systems.
   - Facilitates rapid prototyping and ease of automation via cron or AWS CloudWatch Events.

2. **AWS S3 for Storage:**  
   - Provides a scalable, durable, and cost-effective solution for storing raw and processed data.
   - Separation into raw and processed buckets ensures data integrity and ease of reprocessing if needed.

3. **Per-Session Logging:**  
   - Each ETL run creates a separate log directory with detailed, timestamped logs.
   - This allows for easier debugging, performance monitoring, and auditability.

4. **Modular Design:**  
   - The pipeline is split into distinct phases (ingestion, transformation, upload) for clarity.
   - Each phase can be modified independently, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

## Future Enhancements

- **Automated Testing:**  
  Integrate unit tests for individual scripts to ensure reliability.
- **Advanced Data Quality Checks:**  
  Incorporate tools like AWS Glue DataBrew for enhanced data quality monitoring.
- **Serverless Options:**  
  Consider migrating some processing tasks to AWS Lambda for improved scalability and cost-efficiency.
